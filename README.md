üé• Client Project - Portfolio website for a theatre director
</h1>

## Introduction 
The dynamic, responsive website is built for a theatre director, showcasing their body of work, projects, and artistic vision using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Motive Framer is employed for smoothing scrolling, and React-Form is utilized for handling form submissions. I meticulously designed the entire website to provide an excellent user experience, ensuring that all functionalities work seamlessly together.
